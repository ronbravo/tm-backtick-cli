# Backtick CLI

A browser tool managing bookmarks and page info. Information is saved in the user's home directory in JSON5 format (Might use [EKON](https://github.com/ekon-org/ekon) in the future as it's JSON5 compatible). Backtick is made to work with Tampermonkey so that it can load in any browser page and can be used for various tasks you may have.

## TODO

- [ ] add unit tests
